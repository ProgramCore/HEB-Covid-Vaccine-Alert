# HEB-Covid-Vaccine-Alert
This small app interfaces with HEB's Covid-19 vaccine web service, and uses selected cities to scan for and alert when there are slots available for the vaccine. The alert is a Discord message using Discord Webhooks that were set up previously.

## Why
My friend's and I were having trouble getting to the vaccine when our phase was allowed to get it. Instead F5'ing all of the time, I wrote up this small app that would use the cities that we live in or nearby to check the HEB's service and alert us of vaccine slots. 

Now it is sort of a product of its' time. It's pretty easy to get the vaccine now :syringe:
